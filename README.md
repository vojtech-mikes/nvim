# Vojtovo dotfiles

Collections of my nvim configuration.

> In progress for eternity

## Do not forger to install:

- fzf
- ripgrep
- fd

## Notes:

- Move this back to the dotfiles repository after migration to Debian 12
- Consolidate it with i3 and Ghostty (hopefully) configuration
- Maybe some install scripts for needed apps?
    - This could be flakes for Nix?
